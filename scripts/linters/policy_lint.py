policy_lint — deterministic quality rules for the *content* of a policy kit.

``linter.py`` checks that the ``docs/``, ``inputs/`` and ``policies/`` trees
reconcile with each other (does every documented argument have a policy, a
fixture pair and the right file names). It says nothing about whether the policy
those files contain is any good. This linter reads the declarations themselves —
the ``conditions`` list of every ``<argument>.rego``, the ``variables`` of every
``_vars.rego``, and the committed Terraform plan behind every fixture pair — and
reports the smells a marker would otherwise have to find by hand.

Every rule is deterministic and carries a stable id (see ``RULES``), so a finding
can be cited, suppressed by fixing it, and counted over time. Nothing here writes
to ``docs/``, ``policies/`` or ``inputs/``.

How a policy is read
--------------------
A policy file is a *data declaration*, not logic::

    package terraform.<platform>.security.<service>.<resource_type>.<argument>

    conditions := [
      [ {"situation_description": ..., "remedies": [...]},        # what the human is told
        {"condition": ..., "attribute_path": [...],               # what is actually checked
         "values": [...], "policy_type": "whitelist"} ],
      ...
    ]

so the conditions are read by evaluating them with ``opa eval`` rather than by
parsing Rego text — the evaluated value is what the pipeline actually uses.
``_vars.rego`` (``package ....<resource_type>.vars``) holds the shared
``friendly_resource_name`` / ``resource_type`` / ``resource_value_name``.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/linters/policy_lint.py "gcp/Cloud Storage/google_storage_bucket"
    python3 scripts/linters/policy_lint.py "gcp/Cloud Storage"      # whole service
    python3 scripts/linters/policy_lint.py gcp                      # whole platform
    python3 scripts/linters/policy_lint.py --json "gcp/BigQuery/google_bigquery_table"
    python3 scripts/linters/policy_lint.py --list-rules

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 at least one *error*-severity finding (warnings never fail
a build on their own), 2 a usage or environment error — a target naming a
platform, service or resource type that is not in the tree, or a missing ``opa``
binary. When the named resource type simply has no ``policies/`` directory yet,
the stderr line is marked ``[ERROR] no-policies-dir: <target> (...)`` so a caller
can treat it as "nothing to lint" rather than as a typo.

# Advisory rules: two style conventions, plus presence-only — whether "presence

#
# `repeated-helper-call` is deliberately NOT here: it is an error, by the owner's

# 2026-08-31, 498 of 1,395 policy files carried the pattern — but the mechanical
# cleanup (PR #565) takes that to 5, and those 5 are skipped only because open
# Service/* branches are editing them.
#
# What keeps a backlog from reaching someone who did not write it is structural,
# not the severity: run_precommit_linter.py fails only on findings the
# contributor OWNS (a file their own branch changed — see `_finding_owned`), and

# showing a compliant and a non-compliant value of it necessarily changes which
# member of that set is populated. Asking these authors to remove the difference
# would be asking for a fixture terraform will not accept.
#
# This is NOT a way to silence a finding you would rather not fix. It lives in
# scripts/, which a Service branch cannot edit, so adding one takes a maintainer —
# and each entry has to say what the mutually exclusive set is. A fixture that
# stops drifting makes its entry stale, and a test over the real tree fails when
# that happens, so the list cannot quietly rot.
