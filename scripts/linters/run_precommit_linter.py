"""Lint gate: run the linter but only fail on the author's *own* changes.

The linter (scripts/linters/linter.py) is whole-tree by design — it must build
the full docs index to reconcile inputs/ and policies/ against it, so it cannot
meaningfully lint a single file in isolation. To hold contributors to their own
work *without* blocking them on the repo-wide backlog, we run the linter once
over the whole tree (with --content-checks) and fail only on error lines whose
path intersects the changed set. Pre-existing errors elsewhere are reported as a
count but never block.

The same "own it, don't block on the backlog" treatment applies to
``policy_lint`` (scripts/linters/policy_lint.py): every resource type touched
under policies/ or inputs/ is content-linted, but an individual finding only
fails the run when the .rego file (or, for a fixture finding, the argument
directory) it names was itself changed — a sibling argument's pre-existing
finding never blocks you. See Guide/Policy_writing_tutorial/policy-lint.md.

Within a file you did touch, ``policy_lint`` goes one step further: a finding
only fails the run when your change *introduced* it. The same resource types are
linted a second time against the **base** tree — a detached ``git worktree`` of
the merge-base, thrown away afterwards — and anything already there is reported
as inherited context rather than as your fault. Removing findings can therefore
never fail.

A finding is identified by ``(rule, service, resource, policy)``, deliberately
NOT including the message: messages carry line numbers and counts that shift
when a file is legitimately edited, and a shifted message must not read as a new
problem. Identities are compared by *count*, so going from one hard-coded value
in a file to two still fails.

The base run is not free, so it is bought only where it can pay: only the
resource types that actually produced a finding you own at HEAD are linted on
the base tree, and when your change is clean the base tree is never built at all.

Modes (run from the repo root):
  (no args)         pre-commit: changed set = staged + unstaged worktree edits
  --base <ref>      CI/PR:      changed set = everything this branch changed vs
                                the merge-base with <ref> (e.g. origin/dev)
  --all             maintainer: no filter — fail on ANY error in the tree
