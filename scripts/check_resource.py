"""Everything CI will check about your resource, in one command.

Run it with no arguments on your ``Service/<platform>/<service_slug>/<resource_type>``
branch::

    python3 scripts/check_resource.py

It runs the same checks the pull-request workflows run, in the same order, and
tells you which one failed:

  1. Branch name           scripts/linters/check_branch_name.py
  2. Branch scope          scripts/linters/branch_scope.py
  3. Lint (changed files)  scripts/linters/run_precommit_linter.py
                           -> structure + policy content, failing only on what
                              this branch changed or introduced
  4. Doc completeness      every leaf argument in docs/<platform>/<folder>/<resource>.json
                           has a REAL boolean ``security_impact`` (the "true/false"
                           placeholder the linter tolerates tree-wide is rejected
                           here) and a non-empty ``rationale``, and no argument in
                           the base branch's copy of the doc is missing from it
  5. True-arg coverage     every argument with ``security_impact: true`` has both a
                           policy ``policies/.../<resource>/<arg>.rego`` and a fixture
                           ``inputs/.../<resource>/<arg>/``
  6. OPA test              scripts/auto_test/auto_test.py scoped to the resource
                           (terraform plan + opa eval), which also enforces
                           input<->policy pairing

Steps 4-6 are the *resource gate*: they are the checks that only make sense for one
resource, and they are what CI's ``policy_check`` job runs (with ``--gate-only``,
because its ``lint`` job has already run 1-3 for every branch, Service or not).

Non-``Service/`` branches skip the resource gate and exit 0 — there is no single
resource to check.

Options
-------
``--branch <ref>``   the branch to check. Defaults to ``$GITHUB_HEAD_REF`` in CI, and
                     to the branch you have checked out everywhere else.
``--gate-only``      run only steps 4-6. For callers that have already run the
                     linters and the branch guards themselves: CI's policy_check job,
                     and the pre-commit hook.
``--if-cached``      skip the OPA test when any of the resource's fixtures has no
                     committed plan, instead of building one. A missing plan means
                     terraform has to run, and on a fresh clone that first run also
                     downloads the provider mirror — minutes of network, which is
                     not something a git hook may do to you. Used by the pre-commit
                     hook; never use it as your final check before pushing.
``--changed-only``   skip steps whose inputs this commit does not touch, judged from
                     the staged files. Also for the pre-commit hook: it runs on every
                     commit, and most commits change nothing this gate reads.

Exits 0 when everything passed (or was legitimately skipped), 1 on any failure.
