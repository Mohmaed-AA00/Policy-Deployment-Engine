# --- Project-local Terraform provider cache -------------------------------
# Everything provider-related is scoped to <repo>/.terraform-cache so running
# tests never touches $HOME/.terraform.d or any other project on the machine.
# cli.tfrc points Terraform at a filesystem mirror of the single unified provider
# version, which makes per-directory `terraform init` fully offline and
# re-download-free (the provider is fetched once when the mirror is built).

# --- Committed plan-JSON cache --------------------------------------------
# `terraform plan` (provider schema load) is ~90% of per-policy time, but the
# fixtures are static, so a fixture's plan JSON only changes when its *.tf or the
# provider version changes. So the plan is committed, as `<sha>.json` INSIDE the
# fixture directory next to the *.tf files it was planned from. On a run, a cache
# hit feeds OPA directly and skips terraform entirely; a miss runs terraform once
# and writes the file. The target provider version is read from
# provider_version.txt (the single source of truth shared with cache_setup.sh),
# so a provider bump invalidates every cached plan.
#
# The sha is the whole validity check: the file is a hit only because its NAME is
# the hash of the *.tf beside it, so an edited fixture cannot silently be tested
# against the plan of its old config. Keeping the plan in the fixture dir (rather
# than a central inputs/plan_cache/) is what makes staleness a local question —
# any sibling *.json that is not `<current sha>.json` is stale by construction, so
# prune_stale_plans() below is correct on a single-fixture run and needs no
# whole-platform sweep to identify orphans.
#
# The file is a pure `terraform show -json` document: nothing wraps it, so OPA,
# jq and the linters all read it as the plan it is.
#
# fixture_sha() and plan_cache_path() are the ONLY definition of "which plan
# belongs to this fixture". The linters and the portal import them rather than
# re-deriving a path or a hash, which is why a provider bump — or this move out
# of inputs/plan_cache/ — changed the answer everywhere at once. Do not inline
# either of them anywhere; import them.
TARGET_PROVIDER_VERSION = (Path(__file__).resolve().parent / "provider_version.txt").read_text().strip()
