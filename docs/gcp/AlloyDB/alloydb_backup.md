| `display_name` | User-settable and human-readable display name for the Backup. | false | false | None | None | None |
| `labels` | User-defined labels for the alloydb backup. An object containing a list of "key": value pairs. Example: { "name": "wrench", "mass": "1.3kg", "count": "3" }. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource. | false | false | None | None | None |
