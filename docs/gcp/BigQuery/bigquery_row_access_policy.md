## Argument Reference  

| Argument | Description | Required | Security Impact | Rationale | Compliant | Non-Compliant |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `dataset_id` | The ID of the dataset containing this row access policy. | true | false | None | None | None |
| `table_id` | The ID of the table containing this row access policy. | true | false | None | None | None |
| `policy_id` | The ID of the row access policy. The ID must contain only letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), or underscores (_). The maximum length is 256 characters. | true | true | table_id uniquely identifies the row access policy | table_id | invalid_table_id |
| `filter_predicate` | A SQL boolean expression that represents the rows defined by this row access policy, similar to the boolean expression in a WHERE clause of a SELECT query on a table. References to other tables, routines, and temporary functions are not supported. Examples: region="EU" date_field = CAST('2019-9-27' as DATE) nullable_field is not NULL numeric_field BETWEEN 1.0 AND 5.0 | true | true | filter_predicate defines the access control rules for the row access policy | "region='australia-southeast1' | region='EU' |
| `grantees` | Input only. The optional list of iam_member users or groups that specifies the initial members that the row-level access policy should be created with. grantees types: - "user:alice@example.com": An email address that represents a specific Google account. - "serviceAccount:my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com": An email address that represents a service account. - "group:admins@example.com": An email address that represents a Google group. - "domain:example.com":The Google Workspace domain (primary) that represents all the users of that domain. - "allAuthenticatedUsers": A special identifier that represents all service accounts and all users on the internet who have authenticated with a Google Account. This identifier includes accounts that aren't connected to a Google Workspace or Cloud Identity domain, such as personal Gmail accounts. Users who aren't authenticated, such as anonymous visitors, aren't included. - "allUsers":A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet, including authenticated and unauthenticated users. Because BigQuery requires authentication before a user can access the service, allUsers includes only authenticated users. | false | true | grantees define who gets access to the row access policy | valid_user | allUsers |
| `project` | If it is not provided, the provider project is used. | false | false | None | None | None |
