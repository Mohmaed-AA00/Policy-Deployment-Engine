| `backend` | Id of the backend that this Traffic config applies to | true | false | Backend ID is a reference with no direct security implications. | c | nc |
| `target` | Set to manually control the desired traffic for the backend. This will cause current to eventually match this value. The percentages must add up to 100. Structure is [documented below](#nested_target). | false | false | Manual traffic targeting has no specific security policy. | None | None |
| `rollout_policy` | The policy for how builds and rollouts are triggered and rolled out. Structure is [documented below](#nested_rollout_policy). | false | true | Rollout policy must specify approved source branches to ensure only production-ready code is deployed. | Refer to child arguments | Refer to child arguments |
| `project` | If it is not provided, the provider project is used. | false | false | Project specification uses default provider project when not specified. | None | None |
| `splits` |  | false | false | Traffic splits configuration has no specific security policy. | None | None |

### target Block

| Argument | Description | Required | Security Impact | Rationale | Compliant | Non-Compliant |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
