## Argument Reference  

| Argument | Description | Required | Security Impact | Rationale | Compliant | Non-Compliant |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `security_gateways_id` | The security id of the BeyondCorp Application. In the format: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/securityGateways/{security_gateway_id}`. | true | false | The security gateway ID is required to identify the specific BeyondCorp Application for which the IAM policy is being managed. | None | None |
| `application_id` | The application id for which the IAM policy is being specified. In the format: `projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/applications/{application_id}`. | true | false | The application ID is necessary to identify the specific BeyondCorp Application for which the IAM policy is being managed. | None | None |
| `project` | If it is not provided, the project will be parsed from the identifier of the parent resource. If no project is provided in the parent identifier and no project is specified, the provider project is used. | false | false | The project argument allows for explicit specification of the GCP project in which the BeyondCorp Application resides, providing flexibility in resource management. | None | None |
| `member/members` | Each entry can have one of the following values: * **allUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is on the internet; with or without a Google account. * **allAuthenticatedUsers**: A special identifier that represents anyone who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account. * **user:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a specific Google account. For example, alice@gmail.com or joe@example.com. * **serviceAccount:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a service account. For example, my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com. * **group:{emailid}**: An email address that represents a Google group. For example, admins@example.com. * **domain:{domain}**: A G Suite domain (primary, instead of alias) name that represents all the users of that domain. For example, google.com or example.com. * **projectOwner:projectid**: Owners of the given project. For example, "projectOwner:my-example-project" * **projectEditor:projectid**: Editors of the given project. For example, "projectEditor:my-example-project" * **projectViewer:projectid**: Viewers of the given project. For example, "projectViewer:my-example-project" | true | true | The member/members field is crucial for defining who has access to the BeyondCorp Application, directly impacting security. | user:jane@example.com, user:john@example.com | allAuthenticatedUsers, allUsers |
| `role` | `google_beyondcorp_application_iam_binding` can be used per role. Note that custom roles must be of the format `[projects|organizations]/{parent-name}/roles/{role-name}`. | true | false | The role field is necessary to specify the permissions being granted to the members. | None | None |
| `policy_data` | a `google_iam_policy` data source. | true | false | The policy data is required to define the IAM policy being applied to the BeyondCorp Application. | None | None |
| `condition` | The condition resource defines the conditions under which the IAM policy is applied. Structure is documented below. | false | false | The condition of the IAM policy allows for more granular control over when the policy is applied. | None | None |

### condition Block

| Argument | Description | Required | Security Impact | Rationale | Compliant | Non-Compliant |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `expression` |  The argument of the condition, in the Common Expression Language syntax. The condition's expression must evaluate to a boolean value. If the expression evaluates to true, then the condition is met and the rule is applied. If the expression evaluates to false, then the condition is not met and the rule is not applied. An example expression is: `request.time < timestamp("2020-10-01T00:00:00Z")` | true | false | The expression of the condition is necessary to define the logic that determines when the IAM policy is applied. | None | None |
| `title` | The title of the condition, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This field is used to identify the condition in error messages and in the Cloud Console. The title must be unique within a policy. | true | false | The title of the condition is necessary for identifying the condition in various contexts. | None | None |
| `description` | ~> **Warning:** Terraform considers the `role` and condition contents (`title`+`description`+`expression`) as the identifier for the binding. This means that if any part of the condition is changed out-of-band, Terraform will consider it to be an entirely different resource and will treat it as such. | false | false | The description of the condition is necessary for providing context and understanding the purpose of the condition. | None | None |
