## Argument Reference
| Argument | Description | Required | Security Impact | Rationale | Compliant | Non-Compliant |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `api_config` | Resource name of the API Config for this Gateway. Format: projects/{project}/locations/global/apis/{api}/configs/{apiConfig}. When changing api configs please ensure the new config is a new resource and the [lifecycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle) rule `create_before_destroy` is set. | true | false | The API Config specifies the configuration for the API Gateway and does not directly affect security posture. | None | None |
| `gateway_id` | Identifier to assign to the Gateway. Must be unique within scope of the parent resource(project). | true | false | The gateway identifier is used for resource identification and does not directly affect security posture. | None | None |
| `display_name` | A user-visible name for the API. | false | false | The display name is used for identification purposes and does not directly affect security posture. | None | None |
| `labels` | Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource. | false | false | Labels are used for governance tracking and security classification. They indicate environment, ownership, cost allocation, and API sensitivity, supporting auditing and compliance requirements. | Must include all required labels: environment, owner, sensitivity, cost_center. Allowed values include environment=[production, staging, qa, development] and sensitivity=[public, internal, confidential, restricted]. Example: environment=production, owner=team-a, sensitivity=restricted, cost_center=cc-1234. | Missing one or more required labels (environment, owner, sensitivity, cost_center). Using disallowed values such as environment=prod or sensitivity=top-secret. Empty or undefined label values. |
| `region` | The region of the gateway for the API. | false | false | The region of the gateway is used for resource identification and does not directly affect security posture. | None | None |
| `project` | If it is not provided, the provider project is used. | true | false | The project ID is used for resource identification and does not directly affect security posture. | None | None |
