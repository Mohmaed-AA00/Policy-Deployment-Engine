## Argument Reference
| Argument | Description | Required | Security Impact | Rationale | Compliant | Non-Compliant |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| `api_id` | Identifier to assign to the API. Must be unique within scope of the parent resource(project) | true | false | Identifies the parent API for context only. It does not assign access or modify permissions, so it has no direct security effect. | None | None |
| `display_name` | A user-visible name for the API. | false | false | A user-visible name does not affect security posture as it is only for display purposes. | None | None |
| `managed_service` | Immutable. The name of a Google Managed Service ( https://cloud.google.com/service-infrastructure/docs/glossary#managed). If not specified, a new Service will automatically be created in the same project as this API. | false | false | The managed service name is an immutable identifier and does not affect security posture directly. | None | None |
| `labels` | Resource labels to represent user-provided metadata. **Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration. Please refer to the field `effective_labels` for all of the labels present on the resource. | false | true | Labels are used for governance tracking and security classification. They indicate environment, ownership, cost allocation, and API sensitivity, supporting auditing and compliance requirements. | Must include all required labels: environment, owner, sensitivity, cost_center. Allowed values include environment=[production, staging, qa, development] and sensitivity=[public, internal, confidential, restricted]. Example: environment=production, owner=team-a, sensitivity=restricted, cost_center=cc-1234. | Missing one or more required labels (environment, owner, sensitivity, cost_center). Using disallowed values such as environment=prod or sensitivity=top-secret. Empty or undefined label values. |
| `project` | If it is not provided, the provider project is used. | false | false | None | None | None |
